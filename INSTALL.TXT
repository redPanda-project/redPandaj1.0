Install
=========

You can download redPanda at http://files.redpanda.im/redpanda.tar.gz.

You need Java 1.6 or higher. For the qt GUI you need the 32bit-version of java for windows,
because qt only supports 64bit for linux.
Attention, redPanda uses AES256 so you need the cryptographical extention files installed for
Oracle Java Runtime Environment. Open-jdk normally support AES256.


Run
=========
Just set up the java HOME directory in bin/settings, just ONE line. Like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin\"
or "/home/user/java/jdk1.7.0_15/bin/" pointing to the binarys folder. (Without quotes.)

Start redPanda directly from the redPanda folder not in the bin folder:
Just type
  ./bin/redPanda-console.sh
for the console or
  ./bin/redPanda-qt.sh
for the qt GUI currently not working very properly.

Console Commands
=========
Hit enter for stats.
s - send Message and get keys
M - add Main Channel, currenlty used for debug messages
i - import Channel
N - creates a new channel
rc - remove a channel
L - add all lan ips, still alpha
B - back sync: syncs all messages the other peers has (only from superclients)
xs - saves all private keys and identities to backup.xml using the given password (can be imported with 'xl')
xl - loads all private keys and identities from backup.xml (see 'xs')
R - removes all messages older than one week

speer - migrating to super peer (until restart, see general.dat for persistent settings)
lpeer - migrating to light peer (until restart, see general.dat for persistent settings)

There are much more commands not documented here.
You have to look in the code for more commands at this stage of development.
