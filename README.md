redPanda - secure peer to peer chat


Welcome to redPanda. We aim to develop a secure peer to peer chat with the same comfort as compareable messengers like whatsapp, facebook messenger and co. but give a decentral, secure inferstructure to deliver messages.

There is currently a version for android and a desktop client for windows and linux base on java.

We are currently going von closed alpha to public alpha state and are looking for some people who are interessted in this project and want to set up a solid network for the peer to peer comunication.

Currently the system is not scaleable. So at like 200 user the peers will need much traffic and at 2000 users the supernodes are not able to serve any messages at all.
