Install
=========

You need Java 1.6 or 1.7. For the qt GUI you need the 32bit-version for windows.
Attention, redPanda uses AES256 so you need the cryptographical extention files installed.


Run
=========
Just set up the java HOME directory in bin/settings, just ONE line. Like "C:\Program Files (x86)\Java\jre7\bin\"
or "/home/user/java/jdk1.7.0_15/bin/" pointing to the binarys folder.

Start redPanda directly from the redPanda folder not in the bin folder.
Then type
./bin/redPanda-console.sh
for the console or
./bin/redPanda-qt.sh
for the qt GUI currently not working very good.

Console Commands

Hit enter for stats.
s - send Message and get keys
M - add Main Channel, currenlty used for debug messages
i - import Channel
e - exit
