# What's left to add to the implementation

1. Implement the "Optimized Contact Accounting" features as mentioned in the paper
2. Implement the "Accelerated Lookups" featured as described in the paper
3. Add a setup file on how to setup Kademlia and run it.


Next Steps:
- Write Unit Tests
- Improve multi-threading system
-- I think server is slow in handling requests because the listen method runs in a single thread.
--- Listen() method should create a new thread to handle every incoming request.
- KadStatistician
-- Let the statistician keep track of failed get requests!
